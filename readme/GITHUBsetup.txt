GIT SETUP

The commands below are based on my username and github. Please make the changes as needed 
from your git.

Paul created eastbaycode repository and invited people.
We get into his repository and click fork (will copy the repo into your own github)

Go back to your terminal and gitclone your eastbaycode repository
 	//git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusrename/eastbaycode.git
 	
 	git clone https://github.com/helstone28/eastbaycode.git
 	
	cd eastbaycode
	
check your branch
	git branch 
	
create your new branch
	git branch hien (hien is my own new branch)
	
Note: to delete a branch
	git branch -d branch_name
	
	git checkout develop
	
Sync with upstream
	git remote -v
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/eastbaycode/eastbaycode.git
	
Check again. Make sure your upstream is https://github.com/eastbaycode/eastbaycode.git
	git remote -v

If you did it wrong, remove the upstream and add it again.
	git remote remove upstream
	or
	git remote -rm upstream

Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.	
	git fetch upstream
Check out your fork's local branch: hien
	git checkout hien
	git merge upstream/develop
	
Make any changes now and commit as usual
	git add filename
	git commit -m ""
	
Git push
	git push --set-upstream origin hien
